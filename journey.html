            <h3>Learning Experience</h3>
            <p>This project has the same learning experiences as any project and group work. 
                Project furthered . Group work . </p>

            <h3>Initial Challenges</h3>
            <p>The major challenge was the tight deadlines (5 days to 1 week timeline). It made it a bit difficult since it didn't allow for a lot of time 
                to explore, brainstorm, or more detail/higher quality since it was a rush with the clock especially when myself and other team members were
                juggling other complex projects. The tight deadlines raelly was impactful around the prototype and usability testing phase of the project. </p>
        
            <h3>Growth and Development</h3>
            <p>THis project helped further strenght my skills and expeirence in interactive design (usability testing, prototyping, etc.). 
                It also helped strengthen my coding skills in HTML/CSS/JS. </p>
